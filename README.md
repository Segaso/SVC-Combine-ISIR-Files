# SVC-Combine-ISIR-Files
The purpose of this application is to combine ISIR files to make the importing process into EDConnect and CAMS (our student management system).
I have only tested this application with ISIR files, but other SAIG file types would probably work as well.


##Inspiration
I got the idea to combine the files from a blog post 
https://joshuapangborn.wordpress.com/2012/04/14/combining-isirs-for-faster-import/ .
He used a program that was specific to Banner, so I recreated the project in c#.


##TODO
I need to add some reporting so that there can be some log of what files were in a combined file.
